# Swift TicTacToe
TicTacToe app intitally designed for macOS with a cross compatibility focus. The Â current use case is to train a createML AI model opponent with variable difficulty.
### SwiftUI
Currently in it's early stages, this app runs on macOS in a single view leveraging SwiftUI. This model should allow for simple porting to iOS, iPadOS, and watchOS devices. When the player chooses a square, the computer immediately responds until the game is complete.
### createML
The next phase of this project will be training a createML AI model to play aginst the user. The model will be trained with varying levels of difficulty to keep the game engaging for all users. At this stage, the computer is selecting random locations during it's turn.
